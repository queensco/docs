## Trivia

1. [yabooos](https://www.roblox.com/users/483269827/profile) was the first player to earn the Commissioner rank on the NYPD team. This took more than 3 days of repeating the parking call, which was the only call in-game at that time. In honor of the achievement, the developers framed the photo of the user and placed it in the NYPD station near the holding cells.
2. Before the release of the game, the department was to be initially called "York North Police Department", but the plan was cancelled shortly after.
3. The 2020 Forge Police Explorer was the first vehicle to be added to the team.
